            <li>Bring water to a boil (add a pinch of salt as boiling begins).</li>
            <li>Chop the potatoes into quarters.</li>
            <li>Boil potatoes for about 12-15 minutes. We want them softened but not breaking apart.</li>

            <li>Add butter (AND your beef tallow or bacon fat if available) to the cast iron skillet and turn burner on to medium.</li>
            <li>Drain water from potatoes thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Once the butter is melted completely, add potatoes to the skillet.</li>
            <li>Mix the potatoes around in the skillet to ensure that they are completely coated with fat on all sides.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle half of the seasoning over the top of the potatoes and let them simmer for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix the potatoes around again, making sure all of the sides get a chance to touch the skillet and be seasoned.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the rest of the seasoning over the top of the potatoes and let them simmer for 5 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Cook until you have the desired crispiness and texture, turn off the burner and move all of the contents of the skillet over to a dish for serving.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
